                <p>Hi, I'm Marine! I'm 26 and I live in LA. I moved to live here 2.5 years ago from Yerevan, Armenia. Currently I'm exploring my potential in the tech field as I've been wishing to do for the past few years, after changing jobs in management, marketing and administration. I'm very fond of finding new technologies and playing with the creative aspect of the "automation". It's probably safe to say I'm discovering a passion for visual design and aesthetics.</p>
            
                <p>In my free time I enjoy watching movies, going to yoga, reading and going to the beach. I really want to try bodyboarding because it looks as fun as surfboarding but unlike surfboarding, it looks like it requires zero effort to stand up and try not to fall. My dream is to travel the world which I've still seen very little of. From where I've been so far, one of my favorite cities is Prague in Czech Republic.</p>
